The Mathematics of Monopoly: how likely are you to land on a square? 


[Monopoly](https://monopoly.fandom.com/ "Monopoly Wiki") is a board game of chance in which players go around a board to buy and develop properties. However, not all of the squares have equal probability of being landed on because of two main factors: 

1. Chance and Community Chest cards: 
A mechanism of sending the player to another square or to jail

2. Jail: 
A player goes to jail by rolling doubles three times in a row, getting sent there from Chance or Community Chest card, or landing on Go To Jail. 

I calculated the probabilities of landing on squares in this Jupyter notebook. 

### Main Conclusions
1. Squares do not have the same probability of being landed on. 
2. The squares most likely to be landed on are in descending order: 
  a. Jail
  b. The orange squares (Tennessee Avenue, New York Avenue, St. James Place)
  c. The red squares (Illinois Avenue, Kentucky Avenue, Indiana Avenue)
  d. The yellow squares (Atlantic Avenue, Ventnor Avenue, Marvin Gardens)
