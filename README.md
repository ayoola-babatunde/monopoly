The Mathematics of Monopoly: how likely are you to land on a square? 


[Monopoly](https://monopoly.fandom.com/ "Monopoly Wiki") is a board game of chance in which players go around a board to buy and develop properties. However, not all of the squares have equal probability of being landed on because of two main factors: 

1. Chance and Community Chest cards: 
A mechanism of sending the player to another square or to jail

2. Jail: 
A player goes to jail by rolling doubles three times in a row, getting sent there from Chance or Community Chest card, or landing on Go To Jail. 

I calculated the probabilities of landing on squares in this Jupyter notebook.
